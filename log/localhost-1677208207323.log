utils.js:49 [{…}]0: anime_name: "One Piece"character_name: "Boa"description: "Boa Hancock is a character in the manga and anime series One Piece. She is the captain of the Kuja Pirates and is known as the \"Snake Princess\" due to her ability to turn people into stone by using her devil fruit power.\n\nHancock is a tall and beautiful woman with long black hair and a curvaceous figure. She is known for her pride and haughty demeanor, and she has a habit of turning her nose up at people she deems unworthy of her attention.\n\nDespite her arrogant exterior, Hancock is a complex and multi-dimensional character. She has a tragic past and has endured many hardships in her life, including being enslaved as a child and forced to become a slave in the Celestial Dragons' palace. Her experiences have left her with a deep hatred for men and a fierce loyalty to her fellow Amazonian women.\n\nThroughout the series, Hancock becomes a key ally to the protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, and his crew. She develops romantic feelings for Luffy, although she is initially resistant to his advances due to her own emotional baggage.\n\nOverall, Boa Hancock is a popular and influential character in the world of One Piece. Her complex personality and backstory, as well as her unique abilities, have made her a fan-favorite among viewers and readers alike."feats: "High-level Warlord"id: "Boa"imgurl: "https://practicaltyping.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hancock.png"powers: "Devil Fruit, Haki"stand_level: "35"[[Prototype]]: Objectlength: 1[[Prototype]]: Array(0)at: ƒ at()concat: ƒ concat()constructor: ƒ Array()copyWithin: ƒ copyWithin()entries: ƒ entries()every: ƒ every()fill: ƒ fill()filter: ƒ filter()find: ƒ find()findIndex: ƒ findIndex()findLast: ƒ findLast()findLastIndex: ƒ findLastIndex()flat: ƒ flat()flatMap: ƒ flatMap()forEach: ƒ forEach()includes: ƒ includes()indexOf: ƒ indexOf()join: ƒ join()keys: ƒ keys()lastIndexOf: ƒ lastIndexOf()length: 0map: ƒ map()pop: ƒ pop()push: ƒ push()reduce: ƒ reduce()reduceRight: ƒ reduceRight()reverse: ƒ reverse()shift: ƒ shift()slice: ƒ slice()some: ƒ some()sort: ƒ sort()splice: ƒ splice()toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString()toReversed: ƒ toReversed()toSorted: ƒ toSorted()toSpliced: ƒ toSpliced()toString: ƒ toString()unshift: ƒ unshift()values: ƒ values()with: ƒ with()Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ values()Symbol(Symbol.unscopables): {at: true, copyWithin: true, entries: true, fill: true, find: true, …}[[Prototype]]: Object
